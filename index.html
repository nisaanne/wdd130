            <p>Hello My name is Venisa McAllister and I am from Northern California, USA. I enjoy weaving,
                glass torchwork, making socks, and many other things. I am also learning to code and hope to earn a 
                degree in software development. I have been married to my husband Jon for 25 years and we have six children.

            <p>The United States is a big country. I have lived most of my life in the state of California. I attended Ricks college in Idaho when I was a young adult. Last year my family took a trip to Oregon. I had a great time exploring the local waterfalls. In April two of my daughters and I visited Florida for a dance training convention. Dancers from all across the United States got to meet each other. </p>
